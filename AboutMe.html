		<p style="line-height: 1.75;"> <b>My name is Atharv Adhyapak or I also go by Art for people who have difculty proncing my first name. I'm a student at Brock Unversity, majoring in the Computer Sceince Program with a bachelor of sceince degree. I've always found computers to be facinating, not only for entertainment purposes but for educational stand point as well. Seventh grade, is when the curiousity really sparked in me, mostly becuase it was the time I realized that alot of the people I know in my Life are in the computer field so with so much of an influential aspect around me I was able to look at computers more than just a mouse, keyboard, and a screen, the machinery has been around mankind for decades evolving and making life more easier for people all over the world. So the curiousty began of looking into how it worked and knowing what was going on behind the scenes of the system. Thus, I entered the Computer Science field </b></p>

However there was still labour involved which slightly counts as work experiance just without pay. Now, I was volunteering for a candidate who was a runner up for one of the seats for the House of Commons. I managed two events, one outdoor and the second indoor. In these events the main volunteer work was to decorate the enviorment to make it look presentable and assist the guest if they need andything</b></p>

When I first got hired, it was as Garden Center Associate which invloved helping customers put soil packets in there cars, watering the planets, and cleaning the area. But after a month I relaized I wasn't gaining the most experiance working outside as the most interaction with the customers and other employees happen inside the store. I requested to switch my position working in the store so that I can expand my knowledge and continue working with a strong team of people. And by the next week was given the title of a Filling Associate. Being apart of the filling team required us to work in all departments, learning about all products and collaborating with colleagues to combine opinions. The three months working inside the store was truly an amazing experiance as I got to work with and communicate with such kind people which made the experiance better</b></p>

Now, when it comes to painting and drawing it comes from my mom's side as my grandfather is a professional artist, and my mom also knows here way around with a pencil and paper, so me inherting this skill was kind of natural. I mostly draw stuff that I can see as my imagination hasn't reach that big of spectrum that I can makeup something on the spot.
